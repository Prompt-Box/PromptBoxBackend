# Prompt Box Backend

## Project Summary

### One Sentence Description
  Prompt Box is a 2 player game of one player disguising their written statement in a bunch of AI generated statements while the other player tries to find out which is the human statement.
### Project Overview
  Games are made in lobbies where 2 people can find each others' games.  At first, each player is given some AI generated statements and asked to type their own 3 statements.  Afterwards is the guessing phase, where one player after the other guesses which statement out of 5 is the human's.  In the end, the player who had more of their statements successfully disguised wins. (WIP)
